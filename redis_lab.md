# **Redis Lab: Querying the Movies Dataset**

## **Objective**
This lab will help you practice querying data in Redis using the dataset provided [here](https://redis.io/learn/howtos/moviesdatabase/import#importing-the-movies-theaters-and-users). You will execute a series of progressively challenging queries to retrieve, filter, and manipulate movie-related data.

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset consists of the following key types:
- **Movies**: Stored as hashes with keys like `movie:<id>`
- **Theaters**: Stored as hashes with keys like `theater:<id>`
- **Users**: Stored as hashes with keys like `user:<id>`
- **Ratings**: Stored as sorted sets to track movie ratings
- **Indexes**: Secondary indexes to facilitate searching

## **Lab Instructions**
**Perform the following queries in Redis CLI.**

### **1. Retrieve a Movie by ID**
Fetch details of the movie with ID `1`.
```sh
HGETALL movie:1
```

### **2. List All Movies**
Retrieve all movie IDs stored in Redis.
```sh
KEYS movie:*
```

**Redis CLI does not support some of the operations bellow. You must try them out in Python.**

### **3. Find Movies by Title Prefix**
Find all movies that start with "The Lord of the Rings".

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis()
results = []

for key in r.scan_iter(match="movie:*"):
    title = r.hget(key, "title").decode('utf-8')
    if "The Lord of the Rings" in title:
        results.append(title)
```

### **4. Retrieve Theaters in a Specific City**
Find all theaters located in "New York".

### **5. Get Top-Rated Movies**
Retrieve the top 5 movies based on rating.

### **6. Find Movies Released After 2010**
Retrieve movies where the release year is greater than 2010.

### **7. Get Movies by Genre**
Find all movies labeled as "Action".

### **8. Find Users Who Rated a Specific Movie**
Retrieve all users who have rated the movie with ID `10`.

### **9. Get Movies with Ratings Between 7 and 9**
Find all movies that have a rating between 7.0 and 9.0.

## **Completion**
After executing these queries, you should have a strong understanding of how to interact with Redis and retrieve relevant movie data efficiently. Try modifying the queries to experiment further!

## **Additional Challenges**
- Modify query #5 to return the top 10 rated movies.
- Find the 3 most recent movies added to the dataset.
- Retrieve the total number of users who have rated at least one movie.

Happy querying! ðŸš€
